# Authentication Flow Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Registration Flow Issues
**Problem**: After registration, the app showed a loading screen, then navigated to the root page (orders-onologroup.online), then after a few seconds went to the home page.

**Root Cause**: 
- Supabase configuration has `site_url` set to production URL
- Expo Router origin is set to production URL
- Registration navigation was using `/(tabs)` which redirects to `/home`
- Insufficient delay between registration success and navigation

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Extended loading time in registration process (800ms wait in AuthContext)
- Improved registration success feedback with new `RegistrationSuccessModal`
- Direct navigation to `/home` instead of `/(tabs)` to avoid redirect chain
- Extended delay (4.5 seconds) to allow user to read success messages
- Better console logging for debugging navigation flow

### 2. Logout Stuck State Issues
**Problem**: When signing out, the app and website got stuck in a loading "signing out" state.

**Root Cause**:
- No timeout handling in logout process
- Potential hanging on Supabase auth.signOut() calls
- No error recovery mechanism for failed logout attempts
- AsyncStorage operations for guest users could hang

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Added 5-second timeout in AuthContext logout with forced completion
- Added 3-second timeout for Supabase auth.signOut() calls
- Added 2-second timeout for AsyncStorage operations in guest logout
- Improved error handling with automatic state clearing on failures
- Reduced delays in logout process to prevent stuck states
- Added proper cleanup of timeouts to prevent memory leaks

## New Components

### RegistrationSuccessModal
- Animated modal with success feedback
- Shows user email confirmation
- Email spam folder reminder
- Loading state during navigation
- Professional UI with proper animations

## Code Changes

### AuthContext.tsx
- Enhanced registration method with extended wait times
- Improved logout method with timeout handling and error recovery
- Better console logging for debugging

### AuthService.ts
- Added timeout handling for logout operations
- Improved guest logout with AsyncStorage timeout
- Better error handling without throwing exceptions

### app/auth/register.tsx
- Integrated new RegistrationSuccessModal
- Direct navigation to `/home` instead of `/(tabs)`
- Extended success message display time

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Registration Flow**:
   - Test registration with valid email/password
   - Verify success modal appears and displays correct email
   - Confirm navigation to home page after modal
   - Test on both web and mobile platforms

2. **Logout Flow**:
   - Test logout for registered users
   - Test logout for guest users
   - Verify logout completes within reasonable time
   - Test logout during network issues
   - Confirm app navigates properly after logout

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Test registration with network interruption
   - Test logout with network interruption
   - Test rapid registration/logout cycles
   - Test app backgrounding during auth operations

## Configuration Notes

- Supabase `site_url` remains set to production URL for proper email links
- Expo Router origin remains set to production URL for proper deep linking
- These settings are correct for production deployment
- The navigation improvements handle the redirect behavior properly

## Future Improvements

1. Consider adding offline support for auth operations
2. Implement retry mechanisms for failed auth operations
3. Add biometric authentication support
4. Consider implementing session persistence improvements
5. Add more detailed analytics for auth flow performance
